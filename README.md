# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging console-based Java application that allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project is developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship, demonstrating fundamental Java programming skills, including loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input handling.

Features : 
The program generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The user is prompted to guess the number, receiving feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
The program tracks the number of attempts made by the user.
